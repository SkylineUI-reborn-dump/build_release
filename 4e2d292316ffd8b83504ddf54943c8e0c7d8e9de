The next CL (different topic) changes the value to `False` for `next` where we basically have a huge clamp on all of the unfrozen interfaces so they behave like the last frozen version.\n\n1) question: What kinds of tests do we have running against the `next` config right now in presubmits? I don\u0027t see any of them in my test results.",
