      "message": "@lamontjones@google.com @joeo@google.com this is the first pass at trying to reuse the build flag infra for these flags. Some potential alternatives:\n\n * A single build flag that is just a long list of the FEATURE:VERSION pairs.\n * A build flag that points to the `.xml` file that we want to use as the definitive definition of feature version + unavailable features. \n \n The main requirement is that this can vary at least on a per-form factor basis. Thoughts? Suggestions? Start with this and iterate? The codegen API surface is fairly stable now, so this is more of an implementation detail.",
